description: A non-interactive backup utility for balenaCloud managed devices.
version: 2.2.1
post-provisioning: >-
  ## Usage instructions

  Add a new tag key `backup_tags` in the Dashboard in order to enable backups
  for a specific device.

  The `backup_tags` value should be a comma separated list used to help identify
  snapshots.

  The app will find online devices with that tag and cache the data volumes on a
  local volume or disk.

  Note that a new SSH key will be added to your dashboard as part of the
  authentication process.

  The app will encrypt and upload snapshots of each cache directory to the cloud
  backend of your choosing.

  Connecting a USB storage device is recommended and will automatically be used
  for cache and local backups.
